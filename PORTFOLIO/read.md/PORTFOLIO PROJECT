Detailed Description :

This project is a personal portfolio website created to display my skills, 
educational background, and completed projects in a structured and professional manner.
The website is built using HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on clean design, readability, and smooth navigation.

The portfolio consists of multiple sections:

Hero Section: A brief introduction.

About Me: Details about my background and interests.

Skills: A list of technical and soft skills presented visually.

Projects: Showcases selected works with descriptions .

Contact Section: Provides ways to reach me via email or social platforms.

The design focuses on responsive layout principles, ensuring that the website works seamlessly on
desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. CSS is used to style elements with modern techniques like 
Flexbox, Grid, animations, and hover effects.

Overall, this portfolio serves as a digital identity, helping me present my work to
academic evaluators. It also acts as a foundation that can be expanded later with additional 
features like JavaScript interactivity, a blog, or backend integration.
